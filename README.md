# Modified-MNIST
Image Processing Project which the goal was to perform an image analysis prediction challenge. The task is based upon the MNIST dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The original MNIST contains handwritten numeric digits from 0-9 and the goal is to classify which digit is present in an image. Here, I worked with a Modified MNIST dataset. In this modified dataset, the images contain more than one digit and the goal was to find which number occupies the most space in the image. Each example is represented as a 64 Ã— 64 matrix of pixel intensity values (i.e., the images are grey-scale not color).
